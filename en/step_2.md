## Choose your theme
You are going to create a looping sprites project to change someone's mood. The theme of the project, how it looks and the way the sprites move is up to you.

You can get ideas for your own looping sprites project by investigating projects created by others.

Have a look at these [Looping sprites](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27014672){:target="_blank"} from the Raspberry Pi Foundation Scratch studio.

Click `See inside` to investigate how the projects were made. Each sprite has a different **algorithm** which makes each sprite's movement unique.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.
